# Hub Entertainment Mega


## Description

This project is an entertainment hub that will have movies, series and cartoons, it will have the functions of giving recommendations, saving favorites and seeing what you have seen, but it is still in development.

I will use RXJS for asynchronous threads and Karma with Jasmine to test this application.

Speaking of testing, there are some images that show the code coverage of the application, this helps us know how much of the application is covered in testing.

## Technical requirements

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli), TypeScript, HTML and CSS.

## How to install the project

### First Step: 

You need to have node.js, run the following command: `node --version` and npm installed, confirm that the version number displayed meets the requirements.

### Second Step: 
Remember that after downloading or cloning the project you must stop at your project in the terminal and run: `npm install`

### Final Step 

Install the Angular CLI which provides tooling for effective Angular development from a terminal window run the following command: `npm install -g @angular/cli`.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Sprint 2 and 3

### Goals

- Add the RXJS library to the project
- Test all the functionalities of your application and that the code coverage is greater than 70%.

## Images of Proyect

The images are to see what the application would look like in different resolutions.

## Table Sprint Review

| What was done well? | What can I do differently? | What didn't go well? |
------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------
| Learn to use some Angular | Work a little more efficiently without as many errors | Some tests cannot be performed correctly |

## Testing and Code Coverage

These images are the tests and the code coverage of the applications and their functions.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
